## EdgeMatcher3D
Teaching shape of a "template part" in heightmap and match identical objects with full rotation
### Description
This sample is using an edge-based shape locator for recognition of edge points
above an edge strength threshold.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting a breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after the 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the viewer on the DevicePage.
Select Reflectance in the View: box at the top of the GUI and zoom in on the
data for best experience.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show results after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is
required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator
in AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
